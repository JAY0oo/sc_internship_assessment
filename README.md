# SafetyCulture Internship Take Home Assessment

This is my solution for SafetyCulture's Take home Assessment challange.

## Component Goals

### Component 1: GetAllChildFolders
- Implement the `GetAllChildFolders` method to return all child folders of a given folder.
- Implement necessary error handling.
- Write unit tests for all methods in `get_folder.go`.

### Component 2: MoveFolder
- Implement the `MoveFolder` method to move a folder from one parent to another.
- Implement necessary error handling.
- Write unit tests for the `MoveFolder` method in `move_folder_test.go`.

## Results
- My implementation for both the `GetAllChildFolders` and `MoveFolder` work as expected, passing all unit tests.
- However, I had to introduce an additional parameter, `orgID`, to the `MoveFolder` method. This was done to maintain consistency, as `orgID` is also required by functions in Component 1 (e.g., `GetAllChildFolders`). Additionally, I encountered difficulties accessing `defaultOrgID`, so having `orgID` as a parameter ensures that I can consistently access and work with the correct organization ID across both components.

  
### Sample output 1 - Folders of orgID
These output is the program using a smaller sample size for easier demonstration.
- This is the initial printout of all folders belonging to the organization ID.
- Notice how "golf" has no subfolders.

### Sample output 2 - Child folders of "alpha"
- This output are the subfolders of folder "alpha".

### Sample output 3 - Moving "alpha" to "golf"
- This output moves the folder "alpha" and all its sub folder to "golf".
- After the move, it shows the new folder structure.
- Note: The order of the folders might not be the same as before the move, but this doesnâ€™t affect the functionality since the paths and hierarchy are correct.

### Sample output 4 - List "golf" subfolder
- Using `GetAllChildFolders` list all "golf" new subfolders.
